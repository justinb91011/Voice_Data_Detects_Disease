# Voice_Data_Detects_Disease

In this project we will involve the classfication of 208 voice recordings into healthy or one of three pathological categories: Hyperkinetic dysphonia, Hypokinetic dysphonia, and Reflux laryngitis. Each recording is accompanied by lifestyle information, medical diagnoses, and questionnaire results. The objective is to predict the health status and pathology class of subjects based on their voice recordings.
